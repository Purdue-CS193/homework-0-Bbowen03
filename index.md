## Brenden Bowen's First CS193 Homework

My name is Brenden Bowen and I am a freshman!

My favorite things about CS193 are:

- Easy quizzes
- GPA Booster
- Useful
- Later down the road, this class will be really important

I am going to leave the rest of this here so I can return to it and see how to format my website.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/kalutes/CS193_Fall18_Lab1/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
